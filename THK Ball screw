THK products are commonly used in CNC machine tools to provide precise and smooth motion control. 
THK products that might be used in a CNC machine include: 
Linear motion guides: These are used to guide the movement of machine tool components, such as slides and tables, in a straight line. They consist of a stationary rail and a movable block that rides on the rail. 
Ball screws: These are used to translate rotary motion into linear motion, and are often used in CNC machine tools to move the spindle or other parts of the machine. Actuators: These are mechanical devices that convert energy into motion, and are often used to move machine tool components in a precise and controlled manner. Other mechanical components: THK also manufactures a variety of other components used in machine tools, such as cross-roller bearings and linear bushings, which are used to support and guide moving parts.
